/**
 * edit_file — Perform exact string replacements in files.
 *
 * Adapted from Roo-Code's edit tool. Requires old_string to be unique
 * in the file (or use replace_all for global replacement).
 */
import type { ToolDefinition } from './types'

const EDIT_FILE_DESCRIPTION = `Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use your read_file tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from read_file output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if old_string is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use replace_all to change every instance of old_string.
- Use replace_all for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to edit (relative to the working directory)
- old_string: (required) The exact text to find in the file. Must match exactly, including all whitespace, indentation, and line endings.
- new_string: (required) The replacement text that will replace old_string. Must include all necessary whitespace and indentation.
- replace_all: (optional) When true, replaces ALL occurrences of old_string in the file. When false (default), only replaces the first occurrence and errors if multiple matches exist.`
